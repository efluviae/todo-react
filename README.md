## 🧠 The Process

I wanted to take a basic React first project and add various features that made it feel more complete. I started by making it look more polished, adding various themes and cute design elements, straying from the beginner React app look. I gathered feedback on what people thought was useful in a to-do app, leading to adding the editing tasks and the sorting by date features. The app is sorted in different reusable components, all using the BEM nomenclature system, as well as the mobile-first approach, making it responsive. I learned a lot building this project and I only hope to learn even more!
